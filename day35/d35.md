# Graph
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

time O(1)
SpaceO(n)
## API
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

- add node method :
its take arrgument value  and inside it create  put in adjVertices map

- add edge : take two  value  each one will inseart in list Neibore

- get nodes : its return all node in graph by fetch the key from Map

- get neighbors : each Node  have list of node  this method will return this list

- size :retrtun in number of node in graph 

_ -Breadth : it will move over item s in graph and return all oh them preOreder  ;
BIgO: Time O(N)
        Space O(2N)
